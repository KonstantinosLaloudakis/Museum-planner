# Museum Planner

Museum Planner is an educational project. It is designed to cover a category of users, and specifically museum administrators.
Every museum administrator has the ability to create an account in our application by filling in some trivial data. Using these, he/she can log into the system and perform all the provided functionality. Specifically, there is the possibility of creating a copy of his/her museum layout and saving it in the system. Once saved it can be reloaded for any corrections and changes, as well as for the simulation of the movement of various groups of visitors to it. After performing each simulation, the user has the option of displaying a motion heatmap in the museum layout, which displays the traffic of each point of the museum during the simulation. Through it, the user can observe various intresting parameters regarding the museum, such as popular exhibits, possible crowded areas or even the absence of people.
